    details: `An introvert is a person with qualities of a personality type known as introversion, which means that they feel more comfortable focusing on their inner thoughts and ideas, rather than what’s happening externally. They enjoy spending time with just one or two people, rather than large groups or crowds.
    When you hear the word introvert, you might think of someone who's shy or quiet and prefers to be alone. While that may be true for some introverts, there's much more to this personality type. Whether you're an introvert or an extrovert all depends on how you process the world around you.`,

    message: "You are more of an extrovert",
    details: `Extroverts are often described as the life of the party. Their outgoing, vibrant nature draws people to them, and they have a hard time turning away the attention. They thrive off the interaction.
    On the opposite side are introverts. These people are typically described as more reserved. They may engage in a multitude of social activities, but they need time away from others to recharge their energy.
    In the 1960s, psychologist Carl Jung first described introverts and extraverts when discussing personality elements. (The term now commonly used is extroverts.) He classified these two groups based on where they found their source of energy. In short, Jung argued extroverts are energized by crowds and interaction with the external world. Introverts need alone time to recharge, and they’re often more reserved in their manners and engagement with others.
    As Jung discovered, being an extrovert isn’t an all or nothing option. Instead, most people fall somewhere on a spectrum between the two polar ends. In the years since Jung’s theories first became popular, research has discovered there are genetic and hormonal reasons some people display more extroverted characteristics than others.`,
